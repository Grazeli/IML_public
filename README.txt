In order not to perform all operations sequentially on every data set, a variable is set in the first lines of main.py, named id_data.

This variable indicate which data set to use when executing the algorithms.

Set the desired value accordingly when executing the project.

Notice that a non-sklearn method was used to plot loadings and analyse the components. We assumed that the teacher may not have this library and commented the sections where it is used, to avoid errors when executing.
